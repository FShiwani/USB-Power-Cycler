# USB Power Cycler
A design using an ATMega328P-PU microcontroller to delay the voltage rail pass-through.

## Purpose
The reason behind the design was to delay the start up of a USB car handsfree receiver that would stop functioning due to power being cycling to the device when switching from the ACC to ON ignition states.
